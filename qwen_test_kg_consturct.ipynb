This has led to the development of specialized LLMs for softwareengineering, known as Code LLMs. A considerable portion of Code LLMs is derivedfrom general LLMs through model fine-tuning. As a result, Code LLMs are oftenupdated frequently and their performance can be influenced by the base LLMs.However, there is currently a lack of systematic investigation into Code LLMsand their performance. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey andanalysis of the types of Code LLMs and their differences in performancecompared to general LLMs. We aim to address three questions: (1) What LLMs arespecifically designed for software engineering tasks, and what is therelationship between these Code LLMs? (2) Do Code LLMs really outperformgeneral LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficientin different software engineering tasks? To answer these questions, we firstcollect relevant literature and work from five major databases and open-sourcecommunities, resulting in 134 works for analysis. Next, we categorize the CodeLLMs based on their publishers and examine their relationships with generalLLMs and among themselves. Furthermore, we investigate the performancedifferences between general LLMs and Code LLMs in various software engineeringtasks to demonstrate the impact of base models and Code LLMs. Finally, wecomprehensively maintained the performance of LLMs across multiple mainstreambenchmarks to identify the best-performing LLMs for each software engineeringtask. Our research not only assists developers of Code LLMs in choosing basemodels for the development of more advanced LLMs but also provides insights forpractitioners to better understand key improvement directions for Code LLMs.'\n",

      "Abstract: Many potential applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require guaranteesthat the agent will perform well in the face of disturbances to the dynamics orreward function. In this paper, we prove theoretically that maximum entropy(MaxEnt) RL maximizes a lower bound on a robust RL objective, and thus can beused to learn policies that are robust to some disturbances in the dynamics andthe reward function. While this capability of MaxEnt RL has been observedempirically in prior work, to the best of our knowledge our work provides thefirst rigorous proof and theoretical characterization of the MaxEnt RL robustset. While a number of prior robust RL algorithms have been designed to handlesimilar disturbances to the reward function or dynamics, these methodstypically require additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a baseRL algorithm. In contrast, our results suggest that MaxEnt RL by itself isrobust to certain disturbances, without requiring any additional modifications.While this does not imply that MaxEnt RL is the best available robust RLmethod, MaxEnt RL is a simple robust RL method with appealing formalguarantees.\n",

      "Abstract: The synergies between Quality-Diversity (QD) and Deep Reinforcement Learning(RL) have led to powerful hybrid QD-RL algorithms that have shown tremendouspotential, and brings the best of both fields. However, only a single deep RLalgorithm (TD3) has been used in prior hybrid methods despite notable progressmade by other RL algorithms. Additionally, there are fundamental differences inthe optimization procedures between QD and RL which would benefit from a moreprincipled approach. We propose Generalized Actor-Critic QD-RL, a unifiedmodular framework for actor-critic deep RL methods in the QD-RL setting. Thisframework provides a path to study insights from Deep RL in the QD-RL setting,which is an important and efficient way to make progress in QD-RL. We introducetwo new algorithms, PGA-ME (SAC) and PGA-ME (DroQ) which apply recentadvancements in Deep RL to the QD-RL setting, and solves the humanoidenvironment which was not possible using existing QD-RL algorithms. However, wealso find that not all insights from Deep RL can be effectively translated toQD-RL. Critically, this work also demonstrates that the actor-critic models inQD-RL are generally insufficiently trained and performance gains can beachieved without any additional environment evaluations.\n",

      "Title:  RL$^3$: Boosting Meta Reinforcement Learning via RL inside RL$^2$\n",
      "Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods such as RL$^2$ have emerged aspromising approaches for learning data-efficient RL algorithms tailored to agiven task distribution. However, these RL algorithms struggle withlong-horizon tasks and out-of-distribution tasks since they rely on recurrentneural networks to process the sequence of experiences instead of summarizingthem into general RL components such as value functions. Moreover, eventransformers have a practical limit to the length of histories they canefficiently reason about before training and inference costs becomeprohibitive. In contrast, traditional RL algorithms are data-inefficient sincethey do not leverage domain knowledge, but they do converge to an optimalpolicy as more data becomes available. In this paper, we propose RL$^3$, aprincipled hybrid approach that combines traditional RL and meta-RL byincorporating task-specific action-values learned through traditional RL as aninput to the meta-RL neural network. We show that RL$^3$ earns greatercumulative reward on long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks compared toRL$^2$, while maintaining the efficiency of the latter in the short term.Experiments are conducted on both custom and benchmark discrete domains fromthe meta-RL literature that exhibit a range of short-term, long-term, andcomplex dependencies.\n",

      "Title:  A Simple Reward-free Approach to Constrained Reinforcement Learning\n",
      "Abstract: In constrained reinforcement learning (RL), a learning agent seeks to notonly optimize the overall reward but also satisfy the additional safety,diversity, or budget constraints. Consequently, existing constrained RLsolutions require several new algorithmic ingredients that are notablydifferent from standard RL. On the other hand, reward-free RL is independentlydeveloped in the unconstrained literature, which learns the transition dynamicswithout using the reward information, and thus naturally capable of addressingRL with multiple objectives under the common dynamics. This paper bridgesreward-free RL and constrained RL. Particularly, we propose a simplemeta-algorithm such that given any reward-free RL oracle, the approachabilityand constrained RL problems can be directly solved with negligible overheads insample complexity. Utilizing the existing reward-free RL solvers, our frameworkprovides sharp sample complexity results for constrained RL in the tabular MDPsetting, matching the best existing results up to a factor of horizondependence; our framework directly extends to a setting of tabular two-playerMarkov games, and gives a new result for constrained RL with linear functionapproximation.\n",

      "  Help Optimization?\n",
      "Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a set of probability distributions fromthe Bellman dynamics in distributional reinforcement learning~(RL) that learnsthe whole return distribution compared with only its expectation in classicalRL. Despite its success to obtain superior performance, we still have a poorunderstanding of how the value distribution in distributional RL works. In thisstudy, we analyze the optimization benefits of distributional RL by leverage ofadditional value distribution information over classical RL in the NeuralFitted Z-Iteration~(Neural FZI) framework. To begin with, we demonstrate thatthe distribution loss of distributional RL has desirable smoothnesscharacteristics and hence enjoys stable gradients, which is in line with itstendency to promote optimization stability. Furthermore, the accelerationeffect of distributional RL is revealed by decomposing the return distribution.It turns out that distributional RL can perform favorably if the valuedistribution approximation is appropriate, measured by the variance of gradientestimates in each environment for any specific distributional RL algorithm.Rigorous experiments validate the stable optimization behaviors ofdistributional RL, contributing to its acceleration effects compared toclassical RL. The findings of our research illuminate how the valuedistribution in distributional RL algorithms helps the optimization.\n",

      "Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has demonstrated the potential to help reinforcementlearning (RL) practitioners to understand how RL models work. However, XAI forusers who do not have RL expertise (non-RL experts), has not been studiedsufficiently. This results in a difficulty for the non-RL experts toparticipate in the fundamental discussion of how RL models should be designedfor an incoming society where humans and AI coexist. Solving such a problemwould enable RL experts to communicate with the non-RL experts in producingmachine learning solutions that better fit our society. We argue thatabstracted trajectories, that depicts transitions between the major states ofthe RL model, will be useful for non-RL experts to build a mental model of theagents. Our early results suggest that by leveraging a visualization of theabstracted trajectories, users without RL expertise are able to infer thebehavior patterns of RL.\n",

      "Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is used in various robotic applications. RLenables agents to learn tasks autonomously by interacting with the environment.The more critical the tasks are, the higher the demand for the robustness ofthe RL systems. Causal RL combines RL and causal inference to make RL morerobust. Causal RL agents use a causal representation to capture the invariantcausal mechanisms that can be transferred from one task to another. Currently,there is limited research in Causal RL, and existing solutions are usually notcomplete or feasible for real-world applications. In this work, we proposeCausalCF, the first complete Causal RL solution incorporating ideas from CausalCuriosity and CoPhy. Causal Curiosity provides an approach for usinginterventions, and CoPhy is modified to enable the RL agent to performcounterfactuals. Causal Curiosity has been applied to robotic grasping andmanipulation tasks in CausalWorld. CausalWorld provides a realistic simulationenvironment based on the TriFinger robot.

      "  Learning via the Lens of Representation Complexity\n",
      "Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) encompasses diverse paradigms, includingmodel-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL, each tailored toapproximate the model, optimal policy, and optimal value function,respectively. This work investigates the potential hierarchy of representationcomplexity -- the complexity of functions to be represented -- among these RLparadigms. We first demonstrate that, for a broad class of Markov decisionprocesses (MDPs), the model can be represented by constant-depth circuits withpolynomial size or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with constant layers andpolynomial hidden dimension. However, the representation of the optimal policyand optimal value proves to be $\\mathsf{NP}$-complete and unattainable byconstant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. This demonstrates a significantrepresentation complexity gap between model-based RL and model-free RL, whichincludes policy-based RL and value-based RL. To further explore therepresentation complexity hierarchy between policy-based RL and value-based RL,we introduce another general class of MDPs where both the model and optimalpolicy can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size orconstant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. In contrast, representing the optimalvalue is $\\mathsf{P}$-complete and intractable via a constant-layer MLP withpolynomial hidden dimension. This accentuates the intricate representationcomplexity associated with value-based RL compared to policy-based RL. Insummary, we unveil a potential representation complexity hierarchy within RL --representing the model emerges as the easiest task, followed by the optimalpolicy, while representing the optimal value function presents the mostintricate challenge.\n",

      "Abstract: Classical reinforcement learning (RL) has generated excellent results indifferent regions; however, its sample inefficiency remains a critical issue.In this paper, we provide concrete numerical evidence that the sampleefficiency (the speed of convergence) of quantum RL could be better than thatof classical RL, and for achieving comparable learning performance, quantum RLcould use much (at least one order of magnitude) fewer trainable parametersthan classical RL. Specifically, we employ the popular benchmarkingenvironments of RL in the OpenAI Gym, and show that our quantum RL agentconverges faster than classical fully-connected neural networks (FCNs) in thetasks of CartPole and Acrobot under the same optimization process. We alsosuccessfully train the first quantum RL agent that can complete the task ofLunarLander in the OpenAI Gym. Our quantum RL agent only requires asingle-qubit-based variational quantum circuit without entangling gates,followed by a classical neural network (NN) to post-process the measurementoutput. Finally, we could accomplish the aforementioned tasks on the real IBMquantum machines. To the best of our knowledge, none of the earlier quantum RLagents could do that.\n",

      "Abstract: The recent development of reinforcement learning (RL) has boosted theadoption of online RL for wireless radio resource management (RRM). However,online RL algorithms require direct interactions with the environment, whichmay be undesirable given the potential performance loss due to the unavoidableexploration in RL. In this work, we first investigate the use of \\emph{offline}RL algorithms in solving the RRM problem. We evaluate several state-of-the-artoffline RL algorithms, including behavior constrained Q-learning (BCQ),conservative Q-learning (CQL), and implicit Q-learning (IQL), for a specificRRM problem that aims at maximizing a linear combination {of sum and}5-percentile rates via user scheduling. We observe that the performance ofoffline RL for the RRM problem depends critically on the behavior policy usedfor data collection, and further propose a novel offline RL solution thatleverages heterogeneous datasets collected by different behavior policies. Weshow that with a proper mixture of the datasets, offline RL can produce anear-optimal RL policy even when all involved behavior policies are highlysuboptimal.\n",

Unfortunately,system-level bottlenecks in RL workloads are poorly understood; we observefundamental structural differences in RL workloads that make them inherentlyless GPU-bound than supervised learning (SL). To explain where training time isspent in RL workloads, we propose RL-Scope, a cross-stack profiler that scopeslow-level CPU/GPU resource usage to high-level algorithmic operations, andprovides accurate insights by correcting for profiling overhead. UsingRL-Scope, we survey RL workloads across its major dimensions including MLbackend, RL algorithm, and simulator. For ML backends, we explain a $2.3\\times$difference in runtime between equivalent PyTorch and TensorFlow algorithmimplementations, and identify a bottleneck rooted in overly abstractedalgorithm implementations. For RL algorithms and simulators, we show thaton-policy algorithms are at least $3.5\\times$ more simulation-bound thanoff-policy algorithms. Finally, we profile a scale-up workload and demonstratethat GPU utilization metrics reported by commonly used tools dramaticallyinflate GPU usage, whereas RL-Scope reports true GPU-bound time.

      "  Dynamics\n",
      "Abstract: Poisoning attacks on Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems could take advantageof RL algorithm's vulnerabilities and cause failure of the learning. However,prior works on poisoning RL usually either unrealistically assume the attackerknows the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), or directly apply thepoisoning methods in supervised learning to RL. In this work, we build ageneric poisoning framework for online RL via a comprehensive investigation ofheterogeneous poisoning models in RL. Without any prior knowledge of the MDP,we propose a strategic poisoning algorithm called Vulnerability-AwareAdversarial Critic Poison (VA2C-P), which works for most policy-based deep RLagents, closing the gap that no poisoning method exists for policy-based RLagents. VA2C-P uses a novel metric, stability radius in RL, that measures thevulnerability of RL algorithms. Experiments on multiple deep RL agents andmultiple environments show that our poisoning algorithm successfully preventsagents from learning a good policy or teaches the agents to converge to atarget policy, with a limited attacking budget.\n",

      "Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents with pre-specified reward functions cannotprovide guaranteed safety across variety of circumstances that an uncertainsystem might encounter. To guarantee performance while assuring satisfaction ofsafety constraints across variety of circumstances, an assured autonomouscontrol framework is presented in this paper by empowering RL algorithms withmetacognitive learning capabilities. More specifically, adapting the rewardfunction parameters of the RL agent is performed in a metacognitivedecision-making layer to assure the feasibility of RL agent. That is, to assurethat the learned policy by the RL agent satisfies safety constraints specifiedby signal temporal logic while achieving as much performance as possible. Themetacognitive layer monitors any possible future safety violation under theactions of the RL agent and employs a higher-layer Bayesian RL algorithm toproactively adapt the reward function for the lower-layer RL agent. To minimizethe higher-layer Bayesian RL intervention, a fitness function is leveraged bythe metacognitive layer as a metric to evaluate success of the lower-layer RLagent in satisfaction of safety and liveness specifications, and thehigher-layer Bayesian RL intervenes only if there is a risk of lower-layer RLfailure. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate theeffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

      "Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in many complexdecision making tasks. When it comes to deploying RL in the real world, safetyconcerns are usually raised, leading to a growing demand for safe RLalgorithms, such as in autonomous driving and robotics scenarios. While safetycontrol has a long history, the study of safe RL algorithms is still in theearly stages. To establish a good foundation for future research in thisthread, in this paper, we provide a review for safe RL from the perspectives ofmethods, theory and applications. Firstly, we review the progress of safe RLfrom five dimensions and come up with five problems that are crucial for safeRL being deployed in real-world applications, coined as \"2H3W\". Secondly, weanalyze the theory and algorithm progress from the perspectives of answeringthe \"2H3W\" problems. Then, the sample complexity of safe RL methods is reviewedand discussed, followed by an introduction of the applications and benchmarksof safe RL algorithms. Finally, we open the discussion of the challengingproblems in safe RL, hoping to inspire more future research on this thread.  To advance the study of safe RL algorithms, we release a benchmark suite, anopen-sourced repository containing the implementations of major safe RLalgorithms, along with tutorials at the link:https://github.com/chauncygu/Safe-Reinforcement-Learning-Baselines.git.\n",

      "  Accelerate Progress\n",
      "Abstract: Learning tabula rasa, that is without any prior knowledge, is the prevalentworkflow in reinforcement learning (RL) research. However, RL systems, whenapplied to large-scale settings, rarely operate tabula rasa. Such large-scalesystems undergo multiple design or algorithmic changes during their developmentcycle and use ad hoc approaches for incorporating these changes withoutre-training from scratch, which would have been prohibitively expensive.Additionally, the inefficiency of deep RL typically excludes researcherswithout access to industrial-scale resources from tacklingcomputationally-demanding problems. To address these issues, we presentreincarnating RL as an alternative workflow or class of problem settings, whereprior computational work (e.g., learned policies) is reused or transferredbetween design iterations of an RL agent, or from one RL agent to another. As astep towards enabling reincarnating RL from any agent to any other agent, wefocus on the specific setting of efficiently transferring an existingsub-optimal policy to a standalone value-based RL agent. We find that existingapproaches fail in this setting and propose a simple algorithm to address theirlimitations. Equipped with this algorithm, we demonstrate reincarnating RL'sgains over tabula rasa RL on Atari 2600 games, a challenging locomotion task,and the real-world problem of navigating stratospheric balloons. Overall, thiswork argues for an alternative approach to RL research, which we believe couldsignificantly improve real-world RL adoption and help democratize it further.Open-sourced code and trained agents athttps://agarwl.github.io/reincarnating_rl.\n",

      "Abstract: Experimentally, it has been observed that humans and animals often makedecisions that do not maximize their expected utility, but rather chooseoutcomes randomly, with probability proportional to expected utility.Probability matching, as this strategy is called, is equivalent to maximumentropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL). However, MaxEnt RL does notoptimize expected utility. In this paper, we formally show that MaxEnt RL doesoptimally solve certain classes of control problems with variability in thereward function. In particular, we show (1) that MaxEnt RL can be used to solvea certain class of POMDPs, and (2) that MaxEnt RL is equivalent to a two-playergame where an adversary chooses the reward function. These results suggest adeeper connection between MaxEnt RL, robust control, and POMDPs, and provideinsight for the types of problems for which we might expect MaxEnt RL toproduce effective solutions. Specifically, our results suggest that domainswith uncertainty in the task goal may be especially well-suited for MaxEnt RLmethods.\n",

That is, RL agents can learn, as we learn. Giventhe importance of learning in our intelligence, RL has been thought to be oneof key components to general artificial intelligence, and recent breakthroughsin deep reinforcement learning suggest that neural networks (NN) are naturalplatforms for RL agents. However, despite the efficiency and versatility ofNN-based RL agents, their decision-making remains incomprehensible, reducingtheir utilities. To deploy RL into a wider range of applications, it isimperative to develop explainable NN-based RL agents. Here, we propose a methodto derive a secondary comprehensible agent from a NN-based RL agent, whosedecision-makings are based on simple rules.

      "Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixedbatch of data. Due to errors in value estimation from out-of-distributionactions, most offline RL algorithms take the approach of constraining orregularizing the policy with the actions contained in the dataset. Built onpre-existing RL algorithms, modifications to make an RL algorithm work offlinecomes at the cost of additional complexity. Offline RL algorithms introduce newhyperparameters and often leverage secondary components such as generativemodels, while adjusting the underlying RL algorithm. In this paper we aim tomake a deep RL algorithm work while making minimal changes. We find that we canmatch the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by simplyadding a behavior cloning term to the policy update of an online RL algorithmand normalizing the data.

      "Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the goal of agents is to discover an optimalpolicy that maximizes the expected cumulative rewards. This objective may alsobe viewed as finding a policy that optimizes a linear function of itsstate-action occupancy measure, hereafter referred as Linear RL. However, manysupervised and unsupervised RL problems are not covered in the Linear RLframework, such as apprenticeship learning, pure exploration and variationalintrinsic control, where the objectives are non-linear functions of theoccupancy measures. RL with non-linear utilities looks unwieldy, as methodslike Bellman equation, value iteration, policy gradient, dynamic programmingthat had tremendous success in Linear RL, fail to trivially generalize. In thispaper, we derive the policy gradient theorem for RL with general utilities. Thepolicy gradient theorem proves to be a cornerstone in Linear RL due to itselegance and ease of implementability. Our policy gradient theorem for RL withgeneral utilities shares the same elegance and ease of implementability. Basedon the policy gradient theorem derived, we also present a simple sample-basedalgorithm. We believe our results will be of interest to the community andoffer inspiration to future works in this generalized setting.\n",

      "  Future Trends\n",
      "Abstract: General large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, havedemonstrated significant potential in tasks such as code generation in softwareengineering. This has led to the development of specialized LLMs for softwareengineering, known as Code LLMs. A considerable portion of Code LLMs is derivedfrom general LLMs through model fine-tuning. As a result, Code LLMs are oftenupdated frequently and their performance can be influenced by the base LLMs.However, there is currently a lack of systematic investigation into Code LLMsand their performance. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey andanalysis of the types of Code LLMs and their differences in performancecompared to general LLMs. We aim to address three questions: (1) What LLMs arespecifically designed for software engineering tasks, and what is therelationship between these Code LLMs? (2) Do Code LLMs really outperformgeneral LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficientin different software engineering tasks? To answer these questions, we firstcollect relevant literature and work from five major databases and open-sourcecommunities, resulting in 134 works for analysis. Next, we categorize the CodeLLMs based on their publishers and examine their relationships with generalLLMs and among themselves. Furthermore, we investigate the performancedifferences between general LLMs and Code LLMs in various software engineeringtasks to demonstrate the impact of base models and Code LLMs. Finally, wecomprehensively maintained the performance of LLMs across multiple mainstreambenchmarks to identify the best-performing LLMs for each software engineeringtask. Our research not only assists developers of Code LLMs in choosing basemodels for the development of more advanced LLMs but also provides insights forpractitioners to better understand key improvement directions for Code LLMs.\n",

      "Abstract: This work summarizes two ways to accomplish Time-Series (TS) tasks in today'sLarge Language Model (LLM) context: LLM-for-TS (model-centric) designs andtrains a fundamental large model, or fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM for TS data;TS-for-LLM (data-centric) converts TS into a model-friendly representation toenable the pre-trained LLM to handle TS data. Given the lack of data, limitedresources, semantic context requirements, and so on, this work focuses onTS-for-LLM, where we aim to activate LLM's ability for TS data by designing aTS embedding method suitable for LLM. The proposed method is named TEST. Itfirst tokenizes TS, builds an encoder to embed TS via instance-wise,feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, where the TS embedding spaceis aligned to LLM embedding layer space, then creates soft prompts to make LLMmore open to that embeddings, and finally implements TS tasks using the frozenLLM. We also demonstrate the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theory andexperiments. Experiments are carried out on TS classification, forecasting, andrepresentation tasks using eight frozen LLMs with various structures and sizes.The results show that the pre-trained LLM with TEST strategy can achieve betteror comparable performance than today's SOTA TS models and offer benefits forfew-shot and generalization. By treating LLM as the pattern machine, TEST canendow LLM's ability to process TS data without compromising language ability.We hope that this study will serve as a foundation for future work to supportTS+LLM progress.\n",

      "Abstract: The proliferation of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from variousinstitutions has highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive evaluationmethods. However, current evaluation platforms, such as the widely recognizedHuggingFace open LLM leaderboard, neglect a crucial aspect -- uncertainty,which is vital for thoroughly assessing LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introducea new benchmarking approach for LLMs that integrates uncertaintyquantification. Our examination involves eight LLMs (LLM series) spanning fiverepresentative natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we introduce anuncertainty-aware evaluation metric, UAcc, which takes into account bothprediction accuracy and prediction uncertainty. Our findings reveal that: I)LLMs with higher accuracy may exhibit lower certainty; II) Larger-scale LLMsmay display greater uncertainty compared to their smaller counterparts; andIII) Instruction-finetuning tends to increase the uncertainty of LLMs. Bytaking uncertainty into account, our new UAcc metric can either amplify ordiminish the relative improvement of one LLM over another and may even changethe relative ranking of two LLMs. These results underscore the significance ofincorporating uncertainty in the evaluation of LLMs.\n",

This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness ofassessment LLMs, where we search for short universal phrases that when appendedto texts can deceive LLMs to provide high assessment scores. Experiments onSummEval and TopicalChat demonstrate that both LLM-scoring and pairwiseLLM-comparative assessment are vulnerable to simple concatenation attacks,where in particular LLM-scoring is very susceptible and can yield maximumassessment scores irrespective of the input text quality. Interestingly, suchattacks are transferable and phrases learned on smaller open-source LLMs can beapplied to larger closed-source models, such as GPT3.5. This highlights thepervasive nature of the adversarial vulnerabilities across different judge-LLMsizes, families and methods. Our findings raise significant concerns on thereliability of LLMs-as-a-judge methods, and underscore the importance ofaddressing vulnerabilities in LLM assessment methods before deployment inhigh-stakes real-world scenarios.\n",

      "  Effectiveness of Prompt-Based Interactions for Software Help-Seeking\n",
      "Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) assistants, such as ChatGPT, have emerged aspotential alternatives to search methods for helping users navigate complex,feature-rich software. LLMs use vast training data from domain-specific texts,software manuals, and code repositories to mimic human-like interactions,offering tailored assistance, including step-by-step instructions. In thiswork, we investigated LLM-generated software guidance through a within-subjectexperiment with 16 participants and follow-up interviews. We compared abaseline LLM assistant with an LLM optimized for particular software contexts,SoftAIBot, which also offered guidelines for constructing appropriate prompts.We assessed task completion, perceived accuracy, relevance, and trust.Surprisingly, although SoftAIBot outperformed the baseline LLM, our resultsrevealed no significant difference in LLM usage and user perceptions with orwithout prompt guidelines and the integration of domain context. Most usersstruggled to understand how the prompt's text related to the LLM's responsesand often followed the LLM's suggestions verbatim, even if they were incorrect.This resulted in difficulties when using the LLM's advice for software tasks,leading to low task completion rates. Our detailed analysis also revealed thatusers remained unaware of inaccuracies in the LLM's responses, indicating a gapbetween their lack of software expertise and their ability to evaluate theLLM's assistance. With the growing push for designing domain-specific LLMassistants, we emphasize the importance of incorporating explainable,context-aware cues into LLMs to help users understand prompt-basedinteractions, identify biases, and maximize the utility of LLM assistants.\n",

However, there is nocomprehensive index of LLMs available. We take advantage of the relativelysystematic nomenclature of Hugging Face LLMs to perform hierarchical clusteringand identify communities amongst LLMs using n-grams and term frequency-inversedocument frequency. Our methods successfully identify families of LLMs andaccurately cluster LLMs into meaningful subgroups.

The emergence of Large Language Models(LLMs) has great potential to reshape the landscape of combatingmisinformation. Generally, LLMs can be a double-edged sword in the fight. Onthe one hand, LLMs bring promising opportunities for combating misinformationdue to their profound world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. Thus, oneemergent question is: how to utilize LLMs to combat misinformation? On theother hand, the critical challenge is that LLMs can be easily leveraged togenerate deceptive misinformation at scale. Then, another important questionis: how to combat LLM-generated misinformation? In this paper, we firstsystematically review the history of combating misinformation before the adventof LLMs. Then we illustrate the current efforts and present an outlook forthese two fundamental questions respectively. The goal of this survey paper isto facilitate the progress of utilizing LLMs for fighting misinformation andcall for interdisciplinary efforts from different stakeholders for combatingLLM-generated misinformation.\n",

We could term this methodas LLMs for Vision because of its employing LLMs for visual-languageunderstanding, yet observe that these MLLMs neglect the potential of harnessingvisual knowledge to enhance overall capabilities of LLMs, which could beregraded as Vision Enhancing LLMs. In this paper, we propose an approach calledMKS2, aimed at enhancing LLMs through empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storageand Sharing in LLMs. Specifically, we introduce the Modular Visual Memory, acomponent integrated into the internal blocks of LLMs, designed to storeopen-world visual information efficiently. Additionally, we present a softMixtures-of-Multimodal Experts architecture in LLMs to invoke multimodalknowledge collaboration during generation. Our comprehensive experimentsdemonstrate that MKS2 substantially augments the reasoning capabilities of LLMsin contexts necessitating physical or commonsense knowledge. It also deliverscompetitive results on multimodal benchmarks.\n",

      "Abstract: Recently, considerable efforts have been directed towards compressing LargeLanguage Models (LLMs), which showcase groundbreaking capabilities acrossdiverse applications but entail significant deployment costs due to their largesizes. Meanwhile, much less attention has been given to mitigating the costsassociated with deploying multiple LLMs of varying sizes despite its practicalsignificance. Thus, this paper introduces \\emph{any-precision LLM}, extendingthe concept of any-precision DNN to LLMs. Addressing challenges inany-precision LLM, we propose a lightweight method for any-precisionquantization of LLMs, leveraging a post-training quantization framework, anddevelop a specialized software engine for its efficient serving. As a result,our solution significantly reduces the high costs of deploying multiple,different-sized LLMs by overlaying LLMs quantized to varying bit-widths, suchas 3, 4, ..., $n$ bits, into a memory footprint comparable to a single $n$-bitLLM. All the supported LLMs with varying bit-widths demonstratestate-of-the-art model quality and inference throughput, proving itself to be acompelling option for deployment of multiple, different-sized LLMs. The sourcecode will be publicly available soon.\n",

      "Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities intext comprehension and logical reasoning, achiving or even surpassinghuman-level performance in numerous cognition tasks. As LLMs are trained frommassive textual outputs of human language cognition, it is natural to askwhether LLMs mirror cognitive language processing. Or to what extend LLMsresemble cognitive language processing? In this paper, we propose a novelmethod that bridge between LLM representations and human cognition signals toevaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We employRepresentational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to mearsure the alignment between 16mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain. We empirically investigate theimpact of a variety of factors (e.g., model scaling, alignment training,instruction appending) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental resultsindicate that model scaling is positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity,and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity.Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU,Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.\n",

      "  Language Model Compression\n",
      "Abstract: The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been hindered by theirsubstantial sizes, which necessitate LLM compression methods for practicaldeployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers a promising solution forLLM compression. However, state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methodshave two key limitations: truncating smaller singular values may lead to highercompression loss, and the lack of update on the remaining model parametersafter SVD truncation. In this work, we propose SVD-LLM, a new SVD-based LLMcompression method that addresses the limitations of existing methods. SVD-LLMincorporates a truncation-aware data whitening strategy to ensure a directmapping between singular values and compression loss. Moreover, SVD-LLM adoptsa layer-wise closed-form model parameter update strategy to compensate foraccuracy degradation caused by SVD truncation. We evaluate SVD-LLM on a totalof 11 datasets and seven models from three different LLM families at fourdifferent scales. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SVD-LLM overstate-of-the-arts, especially at high model compression ratios. The source codeis available at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/SVD-LLM.\n",

      "Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinarycapabilities in many domains, they still have a tendency to hallucinate andgenerate fictitious responses to user requests. This problem can be alleviatedby augmenting LLMs with information retrieval (IR) systems (also known asretrieval-augmented LLMs). Applying this strategy, LLMs can generate morefactual texts in response to user input according to the relevant contentretrieved by IR systems from external corpora as references. In addition, byincorporating external knowledge, retrieval-augmented LLMs can answer in-domainquestions that cannot be answered by solely relying on the world knowledgestored in parameters. To support research in this area and facilitate thedevelopment of retrieval-augmented LLM systems, we develop RETA-LLM, a{RET}reival-{A}ugmented LLM toolkit. In RETA-LLM, we create a complete pipelineto help researchers and users build their customized in-domain LLM-basedsystems. Compared with previous retrieval-augmented LLM systems, RETA-LLMprovides more plug-and-play modules to support better interaction between IRsystems and LLMs, including {request rewriting, document retrieval, passageextraction, answer generation, and fact checking} modules.

      "Abstract: Red-teaming is a common practice for mitigating unsafe behaviors in LargeLanguage Models (LLMs), which involves thoroughly assessing LLMs to identifypotential flaws and addressing them with responsible and accurate responses.While effective, manual red-teaming is costly, and existing automaticred-teaming typically discovers safety risks without addressing them. In thispaper, we propose a Multi-round Automatic Red-Teaming (MART) method, whichincorporates both automatic adversarial prompt writing and safe responsegeneration, significantly increasing red-teaming scalability and the safety ofthe target LLM. Specifically, an adversarial LLM and a target LLM interplaywith each other in an iterative manner, where the adversarial LLM aims togenerate challenging prompts that elicit unsafe responses from the target LLM,while the target LLM is fine-tuned with safety aligned data on theseadversarial prompts. In each round, the adversarial LLM crafts better attackson the updated target LLM, while the target LLM also improves itself throughsafety fine-tuning. On adversarial prompt benchmarks, the violation rate of anLLM with limited safety alignment reduces up to 84.7% after 4 rounds of MART,achieving comparable performance to LLMs with extensive adversarial promptwriting.

      "Abstract: This study constructed a Japanese chat dataset for tuning large languagemodels (LLMs), which consist of about 8.4 million records. Recently, LLMs havebeen developed and gaining popularity. However, high-performing LLMs areusually mainly for English. There are two ways to support languages other thanEnglish by those LLMs: constructing LLMs from scratch or tuning existingmodels. However, in both ways, datasets are necessary parts. In this study, wefocused on supporting Japanese in those LLMs and making a dataset for trainingor tuning LLMs in Japanese. The dataset we constructed consisted of varioustasks, such as translation and knowledge tasks. In our experiment, we tuned anexisting LLM using our dataset and evaluated the performance qualitatively. Theresults suggest that our dataset is possibly beneficial for LLMs. However, wealso revealed some difficulties in constructing LLMs in languages other thanEnglish.\n",

      "Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in variousaspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-criticallegal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whetherthey can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we proposea comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulouslycrafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from threecognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorizeneeded legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:whether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legaltext; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize theirlegal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legaltasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-labelclassification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extractionand generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specificLLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legaldomain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMson legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long wayfrom obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, modelpredictions and evaluation code are released inhttps://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/. We hope this benchmark providesin-depth understanding of the LLMs' domain-specified capabilities and speed upthe development of LLMs in the legal domain.\n",

      "  External Evaluation\n",
      "Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated with human daily applicationsrapidly, many societal and ethical concerns are raised regarding the behaviorof LLMs. One of the ways to comprehend LLMs' behavior is to analyze theirpersonalities. Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities usingself-assessment tests that are created for humans. Yet many critiques questionthe applicability and reliability of these self-assessment tests when appliedto LLMs. In this paper, we investigate LLM personalities using an alternatepersonality measurement method, which we refer to as the external evaluationmethod, where instead of prompting LLMs with multiple-choice questions in theLikert scale, we evaluate LLMs' personalities by analyzing their responsestoward open-ended situational questions using an external machine learningmodel. We first fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictorthat outperforms the state-of-the-art models as the tool to analyze LLMs'responses. Then, we prompt the LLMs with situational questions and ask them togenerate Twitter posts and comments, respectively, in order to assess theirpersonalities when playing two different roles. Using the external personalityevaluation method, we identify that the obtained personality types for LLMs aresignificantly different when generating posts versus comments, whereas humansshow a consistent personality profile in these two different situations. Thisshows that LLMs can exhibit different personalities based on differentscenarios, thus highlighting a fundamental difference between personality inLLMs and humans. With our work, we call for a re-evaluation of personalitydefinition and measurement in LLMs.\n",

      "  Collective Speculative Decoding\n",
      "Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have recently attracted surging interest due totheir outstanding capabilities across various domains. However, enablingefficient LLM inference is challenging due to its autoregressive decoding thatgenerates tokens only one at a time. Although research works apply pruning orquantization to speed up LLM inference, they typically require fine-tuning theLLM, incurring significant time and economic costs. Meanwhile, speculativedecoding has been proposed to use small speculative models (SSMs) to acceleratethe inference of LLM. However, the low acceptance rate of SSM and the highverification cost of LLM prohibit further performance improvement of inference.In this paper, we propose Minions, an LLM inference system that accelerates LLMinference with a collective and adaptive speculative generation. Specifically,Minions proposes a majority-voted mechanism to leverage multiple SSMs tojointly speculate the outputs of LLM, which improves the inference performancewithout introducing prohibitive computation costs for LLM. To better trade offthe number of tokens speculated from SSM and the verification cost of LLM,Minions proposes an adaptive mechanism to dynamically determine the optimalspeculation length of SSM, which can achieve better inference performanceacross different models, datasets, and hyper-parameters. In addition, Minionsdecouples the SSM decoding and LLM verification efficiently and adopts apipelined execution mechanism to further improve the inference performance ofLLM. By comparing with the state-of-the-art LLM inference systems, wedemonstrate that Minions can achieve higher inference throughput and lowerinference time.\n",

      "  Improving Performance\n",
      "Abstract: There is a rapidly growing number of large language models (LLMs) that userscan query for a fee. We review the cost associated with querying popular LLMAPIs, e.g. GPT-4, ChatGPT, J1-Jumbo, and find that these models haveheterogeneous pricing structures, with fees that can differ by two orders ofmagnitude. In particular, using LLMs on large collections of queries and textcan be expensive. Motivated by this, we outline and discuss three types ofstrategies that users can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated withusing LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation, 2) LLM approximation, and 3) LLM cascade. Asan example, we propose FrugalGPT, a simple yet flexible instantiation of LLMcascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries inorder to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPTcan match the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to98% cost reduction or improve the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost.The ideas and findings presented here lay a foundation for using LLMssustainably and efficiently.\n",

      "  Segmentation\n",
      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a model, initially trained ontraining data, to potential distribution shifts in the test data. Most existingTTA studies, however, focus on classification tasks, leaving a notable gap inthe exploration of TTA for semantic segmentation. This pronounced emphasis onclassification might lead numerous newcomers and engineers to mistakenly assumethat classic TTA methods designed for classification can be directly applied tosegmentation. Nonetheless, this assumption remains unverified, posing an openquestion. To address this, we conduct a systematic, empirical study to disclosethe unique challenges of segmentation TTA, and to determine whether classic TTAstrategies can effectively address this task. Our comprehensive results haveled to three key observations. First, the classic batch norm updating strategy,commonly used in classification TTA, only brings slight performanceimprovement, and in some cases it might even adversely affect the results. Evenwith the application of advanced distribution estimation techniques like batchrenormalization, the problem remains unresolved. Second, the teacher-studentscheme does enhance training stability for segmentation TTA in the presence ofnoisy pseudo-labels. However, it cannot directly result in performanceimprovement compared to the original model without TTA. Third, segmentation TTAsuffers a severe long-tailed imbalance problem, which is substantially morecomplex than that in TTA for classification. This long-tailed challengesignificantly affects segmentation TTA performance, even when the accuracy ofpseudo-labels is high. In light of these observations, we conclude that TTA forsegmentation presents significant challenges, and simply using classic TTAmethods cannot address this problem well.\n",

      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods aim to improve robustness to distributionshifts by adapting models using unlabeled data from the shifted testdistribution. However, there remain unresolved challenges that undermine thereliability of TTA, which include difficulties in evaluating TTA performance,miscalibration after TTA, and unreliable hyperparameter tuning for adaptation.In this work, we make a notable and surprising observation that TTAed modelsstrongly show the agreement-on-the-line phenomenon (Baek et al., 2022) across awide range of distribution shifts. We find such linear trends occurconsistently in a wide range of models adapted with various hyperparameters,and persist in distributions where the phenomenon fails to hold in vanillamodels (i.e., before adaptation). We leverage these observations to make TTAmethods more reliable in three perspectives: (i) estimating OOD accuracy(without labeled data) to determine when TTA helps and when it hurts, (ii)calibrating TTAed models without label information, and (iii) reliablydetermining hyperparameters for TTA without any labeled validation data.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that various TTA methods can beprecisely evaluated, both in terms of their improvements and degradations.Moreover, our proposed methods on unsupervised calibration and hyperparameterstuning for TTA achieve results close to the ones assuming access toground-truth labels, in terms of both OOD accuracy and calibration error.\n",

      "Title:  Persistent Test-time Adaptation in Episodic Testing Scenarios\n",
      "Abstract: Current test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches aim to adapt to environmentsthat change continuously. Yet, when the environments not only change but alsorecur in a correlated manner over time, such as in the case of day-nightsurveillance cameras, it is unclear whether the adaptability of these methodsis sustained after a long run. This study aims to examine the erroraccumulation of TTA models when they are repeatedly exposed to previous testingenvironments, proposing a novel testing setting called episodic TTA. To studythis phenomenon, we design a simulation of TTA process on a simple yetrepresentative $\\epsilon$-perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier andderive the theoretical findings revealing the dataset- and algorithm-dependentfactors that contribute to the gradual degeneration of TTA methods throughtime. Our investigation has led us to propose a method, named persistent TTA(PeTTA). PeTTA senses the model divergence towards a collapsing and adjusts theadaptation strategy of TTA, striking a balance between two primary objectives:adaptation and preventing model collapse. The stability of PeTTA in the face ofepisodic TTA scenarios has been demonstrated through a set of comprehensiveexperiments on various benchmarks.\n",

      "Title:  Uncovering Adversarial Risks of Test-Time Adaptation\n",
      "Abstract: Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has been proposed as a promisingsolution for addressing distribution shifts. It allows a base model to adapt toan unforeseen distribution during inference by leveraging the information fromthe batch of (unlabeled) test data. However, we uncover a novel securityvulnerability of TTA based on the insight that predictions on benign samplescan be impacted by malicious samples in the same batch. To exploit thisvulnerability, we propose Distribution Invading Attack (DIA), which injects asmall fraction of malicious data into the test batch. DIA causes models usingTTA to misclassify benign and unperturbed test data, providing an entirely newcapability for adversaries that is infeasible in canonical machine learningpipelines. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the higheffectiveness of our attack on multiple benchmarks across six TTA methods. Inresponse, we investigate two countermeasures to robustify the existing insecureTTA implementations, following the principle of \"security by design\". Together,we hope our findings can make the community aware of the utility-securitytradeoffs in deploying TTA and provide valuable insights for developing robustTTA approaches.\n",

      "Title:  SoTTA: Robust Test-Time Adaptation on Noisy Data Streams\n",
      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to address distributional shifts betweentraining and testing data using only unlabeled test data streams for continualmodel adaptation. However, most TTA methods assume benign test streams, whiletest samples could be unexpectedly diverse in the wild. For instance, an unseenobject or noise could appear in autonomous driving. This leads to a new threatto existing TTA algorithms; we found that prior TTA algorithms suffer fromthose noisy test samples as they blindly adapt to incoming samples. To addressthis problem, we present Screening-out Test-Time Adaptation (SoTTA), a novelTTA algorithm that is robust to noisy samples. The key enabler of SoTTA istwo-fold: (i) input-wise robustness via high-confidence uniform-class samplingthat effectively filters out the impact of noisy samples and (ii)parameter-wise robustness via entropy-sharpness minimization that improves therobustness of model parameters against large gradients from noisy samples. Ourevaluation with standard TTA benchmarks with various noisy scenarios shows thatour method outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods under the presence of noisysamples and achieves comparable accuracy to those methods without noisysamples.

      "  Management\n",
      "Abstract: Prior to the deployment of robotic systems, pre-training the deep-recognitionmodels on all potential visual cases is infeasible in practice. Hence,test-time adaptation (TTA) allows the model to adapt itself to novelenvironments and improve its performance during test time (i.e., lifelongadaptation). Several works for TTA have shown promising adaptation performancesin continuously changing environments. However, our investigation reveals thatexisting methods are vulnerable to dynamic distributional changes and oftenlead to overfitting of TTA models. To address this problem, this paper firstpresents a robust TTA framework with compound domain knowledge management. Ourframework helps the TTA model to harvest the knowledge of multiplerepresentative domains (i.e., compound domain) and conduct the TTA based on thecompound domain knowledge. In addition, to prevent overfitting of the TTAmodel, we devise novel regularization which modulates the adaptation ratesusing domain-similarity between the source and the current target domain. Withthe synergy of the proposed framework and regularization, we achieve consistentperformance improvements in diverse TTA scenarios, especially on dynamic domainshifts. We demonstrate the generality of proposals via extensive experimentsincluding image classification on ImageNet-C and semantic segmentation on GTA5,C-driving, and corrupted Cityscapes datasets.\n",

      "  Adaptation: An Empirical Study\n",
      "Abstract: A deployed question answering (QA) model can easily fail when the test datahas a distribution shift compared to the training data. Robustness tuning (RT)methods have been widely studied to enhance model robustness againstdistribution shifts before model deployment. However, can we improve a modelafter deployment? To answer this question, we evaluate test-time adaptation(TTA) to improve a model after deployment. We first introduce COLDQA, a unifiedevaluation benchmark for robust QA against text corruption and changes inlanguage and domain. We then evaluate previous TTA methods on COLDQA andcompare them to RT methods. We also propose a novel TTA method called onlineimitation learning (OIL). Through extensive experiments, we find that TTA iscomparable to RT methods, and applying TTA after RT can significantly boost theperformance on COLDQA. Our proposed OIL improves TTA to be more robust tovariation in hyper-parameters and test distributions over time.\n",

      "  Classification\n",
      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a technique aimed at enhancing thegeneralization performance of models by leveraging unlabeled samples solelyduring prediction. Given the need for robustness in neural network systems whenfaced with distribution shifts, numerous TTA methods have recently beenproposed. However, evaluating these methods is often done under differentsettings, such as varying distribution shifts, backbones, and designingscenarios, leading to a lack of consistent and fair benchmarks to validatetheir effectiveness. To address this issue, we present a benchmark thatsystematically evaluates 13 prominent TTA methods and their variants on fivewidely used image classification datasets: CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C,DomainNet, and Office-Home. These methods encompass a wide range of adaptationscenarios (e.g. online adaptation v.s. offline adaptation, instance adaptationv.s. batch adaptation v.s. domain adaptation). Furthermore, we explore thecompatibility of different TTA methods with diverse network backbones. Toimplement this benchmark, we have developed a unified framework in PyTorch,which allows for consistent evaluation and comparison of the TTA methods acrossthe different datasets and network architectures. By establishing thisbenchmark, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a reliablemeans of assessing and comparing the effectiveness of TTA methods in improvingmodel robustness and generalization performance.

      "Title:  Test-Time Poisoning Attacks Against Test-Time Adaptation Models\n",
      "Abstract: Deploying machine learning (ML) models in the wild is challenging as itsuffers from distribution shifts, where the model trained on an original domaincannot generalize well to unforeseen diverse transfer domains. To address thischallenge, several test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed toimprove the generalization ability of the target pre-trained models under testdata to cope with the shifted distribution. The success of TTA can be creditedto the continuous fine-tuning of the target model according to thedistributional hint from the test samples during test time. Despite beingpowerful, it also opens a new attack surface, i.e., test-time poisoningattacks, which are substantially different from previous poisoning attacks thatoccur during the training time of ML models (i.e., adversaries cannot intervenein the training process). In this paper, we perform the first test-timepoisoning attack against four mainstream TTA methods, including TTT, DUA, TENT,and RPL. Concretely, we generate poisoned samples based on the surrogate modelsand feed them to the target TTA models. Experimental results show that the TTAmethods are generally vulnerable to test-time poisoning attacks. For instance,the adversary can feed as few as 10 poisoned samples to degrade the performanceof the target model from 76.20% to 41.83%. Our results demonstrate that TTAalgorithms lacking a rigorous security assessment are unsuitable for deploymentin real-life scenarios. As such, we advocate for the integration of defensesagainst test-time poisoning attacks into the design of TTA methods.\n",

      "  for Text-to-Audio Generation\n",
      "Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) havesignificantly propelled the field of AIGC. Text-to-Audio (TTA), a burgeoningAIGC application designed to generate audio from natural language prompts, isattracting increasing attention. However, existing TTA studies often strugglewith generation quality and text-audio alignment, especially for complextextual inputs. Drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art Text-to-Image (T2I)diffusion models, we introduce Auffusion, a TTA system adapting T2I modelframeworks to TTA task, by effectively leveraging their inherent generativestrengths and precise cross-modal alignment. Our objective and subjectiveevaluations demonstrate that Auffusion surpasses previous TTA approaches usinglimited data and computational resource. Furthermore, previous studies in T2Irecognizes the significant impact of encoder choice on cross-modal alignment,like fine-grained details and object bindings, while similar evaluation islacking in prior TTA works. Through comprehensive ablation studies andinnovative cross-attention map visualizations, we provide insightfulassessments of text-audio alignment in TTA. Our findings reveal Auffusion'ssuperior capability in generating audios that accurately match textualdescriptions, which further demonstrated in several related tasks, such asaudio style transfer, inpainting and other manipulations. Our implementationand demos are available at https://auffusion.github.io.\n",

      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses the unforeseen distribution shiftsoccurring during test time. In TTA, both performance and, memory and timeconsumption serve as crucial considerations. A recent diffusion-based TTAapproach for restoring corrupted images involves image-level updates. However,using pixel space diffusion significantly increases resource requirementscompared to conventional model updating TTA approaches, revealing limitationsas a TTA method. To address this, we propose a novel TTA method by leveraging alatent diffusion model (LDM) based image editing model and fine-tuning it withour newly introduced corruption modeling scheme. This scheme enhances therobustness of the diffusion model against distribution shifts by creating(clean, corrupted) image pairs and fine-tuning the model to edit corruptedimages into clean ones. Moreover, we introduce a distilled variant toaccelerate the model for corruption editing using only 4 network functionevaluations (NFEs). We extensively validated our method across variousarchitectures and datasets including image and video domains. Our modelachieves the best performance with a 100 times faster runtime than that of adiffusion-based baseline. Furthermore, it outpaces the speed of the modelupdating TTA method based on data augmentation threefold, rendering animage-level updating approach more practical.\n",

      "Abstract: In this study, a thenoyltriflouroacetone ligand (TTA) with a Tb3+ MOF wassynthesized (Tb=10 and 50% mol) and its structural and luminescent propertieswere analyzed. The metalorganic compound was generated in a simple one-potreaction from terbium nitrate and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone precursors at roomtemperature. By means of FTIR, it was confirmed the presence of carbon groups,which made possible the terbium ion chelation, and also the Tb-O bondsvibration modes. HNMR results confirm that the complex with 10% mol of Tb3+contains three coordinates molecules of TTA and two waters molecules. Thepowders exhibit rod-like morphology with size about 170 nm of diameter and alength about 2 {\\mu}m, the rod-like nature of powders was confirmed by SEM andTEM analyses. By XRD it was concluded that at higher terbium concentration(TTA-50Tb sample) higher the crystallite size and crystallinity, in fact theTTA-10Tb sample shows a partial-amorphous nature. By photoluminescenceanalyses, the 5D4-7FJ (J=3, 4, 5 and 6) emissions were recorded for bothsynthesized samples ({\\lambda}exc=376 nm). Furthermore, it was observed thatthe emission intensity was enhanced in a factor of 3.5 for the TTA-50Tb. Theenergy transfer efficiency from TTA to Tb3+ (antenna effect) was 0.984 forTTA-10Tb and 0.993 for TTA-50Tb. Decay time analyses indicate effectivelifetime of 1.45 and 1.60ms for the samples doped at 10 and 50%, respectively,indicating that the forbidden transition rules are stronger at highercrystallinity. The integrated intensities of the 5D4 - 7F5 (green at 541 nm)and 5D4 - 7F6 (blue at 486 nm) emissions and their intensity ratios IG/IB upon376 nm excitation have been evaluated for TTA-10Tb andTTA-50Tb samples.\n",

      "Abstract: Anomaly detection is a well-known task that involves the identification ofabnormal events that occur relatively infrequently. Methods for improvinganomaly detection performance have been widely studied. However, no studiesutilizing test-time augmentation (TTA) for anomaly detection in tabular datahave been performed. TTA involves aggregating the predictions of severalsynthetic versions of a given test sample; TTA produces different points ofview for a specific test instance and might decrease its prediction bias. Wepropose the Test-Time Augmentation for anomaly Detection (TTAD) technique, aTTA-based method aimed at improving anomaly detection performance. TTADaugments a test instance based on its nearest neighbors; various methods,including the k-Means centroid and SMOTE methods, are used to produce theaugmentations. Our technique utilizes a Siamese network to learn an advanceddistance metric when retrieving a test instance's neighbors. Our experimentsshow that the anomaly detector that uses our TTA technique achievedsignificantly higher AUC results on all datasets evaluated.\n",

      "Abstract: Since experiencing domain shifts during test-time is inevitable in practice,test-time adaption (TTA) continues to adapt the model after deployment.Recently, the area of continual and gradual test-time adaptation (TTA) emerged.In contrast to standard TTA, continual TTA considers not only a single domainshift, but a sequence of shifts. Gradual TTA further exploits the property thatsome shifts evolve gradually over time. Since in both settings long testsequences are present, error accumulation needs to be addressed for methodsrelying on self-training. In this work, we propose and show that in the settingof TTA, the symmetric cross-entropy is better suited as a consistency loss formean teachers compared to the commonly used cross-entropy. This is justified byour analysis with respect to the (symmetric) cross-entropy's gradientproperties. To pull the test feature space closer to the source domain, wherethe pre-trained model is well posed, contrastive learning is leveraged. Sinceapplications differ in their requirements, we address several settings,including having source data available and the more challenging source-freesetting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method 'robust meanteacher' (RMT) on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks CIFAR10C,CIFAR100C, and Imagenet-C. We further consider ImageNet-R and propose a newcontinual DomainNet-126 benchmark. State-of-the-art results are achieved on allbenchmarks.\n",

      "  Shifts\n",
      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model to the targetdomain in a batch-by-batch manner during inference. While label distributionsoften exhibit imbalances in real-world scenarios, most previous TTA approachestypically assume that both source and target domain datasets have balancedlabel distribution. Due to the fact that certain classes appear more frequentlyin certain domains (e.g., buildings in cities, trees in forests), it is naturalthat the label distribution shifts as the domain changes. However, we discoverthat the majority of existing TTA methods fail to address the coexistence ofcovariate and label shifts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel labelshift adapter that can be incorporated into existing TTA approaches to dealwith label shifts during the TTA process effectively. Specifically, we estimatethe label distribution of the target domain to feed it into the label shiftadapter. Subsequently, the label shift adapter produces optimal parameters forthe target label distribution. By predicting only the parameters for a part ofthe pre-trained source model, our approach is computationally efficient and canbe easily applied, regardless of the model architectures. Through extensiveexperiments, we demonstrate that integrating our strategy with TTA approachesleads to substantial performance improvements under the joint presence of labeland covariate shifts.\n",

      "Title:  Improving Black-box Robustness with In-Context Rewriting\n",
      "Abstract: Machine learning models often excel on in-distribution (ID) data but strugglewith unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Most techniques for improving OODrobustness are not applicable to settings where the model is effectively ablack box, such as when the weights are frozen, retraining is costly, or themodel is leveraged via an API. Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a simplepost-hoc technique for improving robustness that sidesteps black-boxconstraints by aggregating predictions across multiple augmentations of thetest input. TTA has seen limited use in NLP due to the challenge of generatingeffective natural language augmentations. In this work, we propose LLM-TTA,which uses LLM-generated augmentations as TTA's augmentation function. LLM-TTAoutperforms conventional augmentation functions across sentiment, toxicity, andnews classification tasks for BERT and T5 models, with BERT's OOD robustnessimproving by an average of 4.30 percentage points without regressing average IDperformance. We explore selectively augmenting inputs based on predictionentropy to reduce the rate of expensive LLM augmentations, allowing us tomaintain performance gains while reducing the average number of generatedaugmentations by 57.76%. LLM-TTA is agnostic to the task model architecture,does not require OOD labels, and is effective across low and high-resourcesettings. We share our data, models, and code for reproducibility.\n",

      "Abstract: Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to anunlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs inan online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods rely on predictions of cross-modalinformation in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions ofgeometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated,leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we proposeReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leveragesreliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3Dsegmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should beconsistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregatesconsecutive frames in a slide window manner and constructs ST voxel to capturetemporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering outST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for eachpoint and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictionsamong both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Experimental results show thatLatte achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different MM-TTAbenchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods.\n",

      "Title:  Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n",
      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distributionshifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on testsamples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this isoften a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in thereal world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the modelperformance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batchsizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quitecommon in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and findthat the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability.Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie,group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer normsdoes not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging intothe failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradientsmay disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie,assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapseissue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method,called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partialnoisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flatminimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promisingresults demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and iscomputationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n",

      "Title:  Zero-Shot Task Transfer\n",
      "Abstract: In this work, we present a novel meta-learning algorithm, i.e. TTNet, thatregresses model parameters for novel tasks for which no ground truth isavailable (zero-shot tasks). In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, ourmeta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with groundtruth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuitionfinds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adaptto a novel-concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts(hand movement or self-motion), without receiving explicit supervision. Weevaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot:surface-normal, room layout, depth, and camera pose estimation. These taskswere chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexityassociated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposedmethodology out-performs state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth)oneach of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer. Wealso conducted extensive experiments to study the various choices of ourmethodology, as well as showed how the proposed method can also be used intransfer learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstsuch efforton zero-shot learning in the task space.\n",

This has led to the development of specialized LLMs for softwareengineering, known as Code LLMs. A considerable portion of Code LLMs is derivedfrom general LLMs through model fine-tuning. As a result, Code LLMs are oftenupdated frequently and their performance can be influenced by the base LLMs.However, there is currently a lack of systematic investigation into Code LLMsand their performance. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey andanalysis of the types of Code LLMs and their differences in performancecompared to general LLMs. We aim to address three questions: (1) What LLMs arespecifically designed for software engineering tasks, and what is therelationship between these Code LLMs? (2) Do Code LLMs really outperformgeneral LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficientin different software engineering tasks? To answer these questions, we firstcollect relevant literature and work from five major databases and open-sourcecommunities, resulting in 134 works for analysis. Next, we categorize the CodeLLMs based on their publishers and examine their relationships with generalLLMs and among themselves. Furthermore, we investigate the performancedifferences between general LLMs and Code LLMs in various software engineeringtasks to demonstrate the impact of base models and Code LLMs. Finally, wecomprehensively maintained the performance of LLMs across multiple mainstreambenchmarks to identify the best-performing LLMs for each software engineeringtask. Our research not only assists developers of Code LLMs in choosing basemodels for the development of more advanced LLMs but also provides insights forpractitioners to better understand key improvement directions for Code LLMs.'\n",

      "Title:  Uncertainty-Calibrated Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting\n",
      "Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shiftsbetween training and test data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testsample. Although recent TTA has shown promising performance, we still face twokey challenges: 1) prior methods perform backpropagation for each test sample,resulting in unbearable optimization costs to many applications; 2) whileexisting TTA can significantly improve the test performance onout-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradationon in-distribution data after TTA (known as forgetting). To this end, we haveproposed an Efficient Anti-Forgetting Test-Time Adaptation (EATA) method whichdevelops an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable andnon-redundant samples for test-time entropy minimization. To alleviateforgetting, EATA introduces a Fisher regularizer estimated from test samples toconstrain important model parameters from drastic changes. However, in EATA,the adopted entropy loss consistently assigns higher confidence to predictionseven for samples that are underlying uncertain, leading to overconfidentpredictions. To tackle this, we further propose EATA with Calibration (EATA-C)to separately exploit the reducible model uncertainty and the inherent datauncertainty for calibrated TTA. Specifically, we measure the model uncertaintyby the divergence between predictions from the full network and itssub-networks, on which we propose a divergence loss to encourage consistentpredictions instead of overconfident ones. To further recalibrate predictionconfidence, we utilize the disagreement among predicted labels as an indicatorof the data uncertainty, and then devise a min-max entropy regularizer toselectively increase and decrease prediction confidence for different samples.Experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation verify theeffectiveness of our methods.\n",

    "# abstract = 'General large language models (LLMs), represented by ChatGPT, havedemonstrated significant potential in tasks such as code generation in softwareengineering. This has led to the development of specialized LLMs for softwareengineering, known as Code LLMs. A considerable portion of Code LLMs is derivedfrom general LLMs through model fine-tuning. As a result, Code LLMs are oftenupdated frequently and their performance can be influenced by the base LLMs.However, there is currently a lack of systematic investigation into Code LLMsand their performance. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey andanalysis of the types of Code LLMs and their differences in performancecompared to general LLMs. We aim to address three questions: (1) What LLMs arespecifically designed for software engineering tasks, and what is therelationship between these Code LLMs? (2) Do Code LLMs really outperformgeneral LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficientin different software engineering tasks? To answer these questions, we firstcollect relevant literature and work from five major databases and open-sourcecommunities, resulting in 134 works for analysis. Next, we categorize the CodeLLMs based on their publishers and examine their relationships with generalLLMs and among themselves. Furthermore, we investigate the performancedifferences between general LLMs and Code LLMs in various software engineeringtasks to demonstrate the impact of base models and Code LLMs. Finally, wecomprehensively maintained the performance of LLMs across multiple mainstreambenchmarks to identify the best-performing LLMs for each software engineeringtask. Our research not only assists developers of Code LLMs in choosing basemodels for the development of more advanced LLMs but also provides insights forpractitioners to better understand key improvement directions for Code LLMs.'\n",
